# Kathara Network Plugin (VDE Switches + tap interfaces)

## How does it work?

</p>

When Docker creates networks using the plugin, a new VDE switch process is created for each required LAN. When a container is added to this network, a tap interface is created and moved into the container's network namespace.

## Advantages
- Forwards arbitrary L2 multicast frames (e.g., STP);
- Behaves like a hub, each container on the LAN receives all the L2 frames;
- Does not generate undesired noise (e.g., [IPv6 router solicitations](https://github.com/KatharaFramework/NetworkPlugin/issues/4));
- You can use any L3 network, even the Docker default network.

## Disadvantages
- VDE switches are less performant than Linux bridges (they are managed in userspace);
- You cannot directly `tcpdump` traffic from the bridge. The solution is to sniff traffic directly from a container interface. 

## `kathara/katharanp_vde` Standalone Mode

It is possible to leverage on `kathara/katharanp_vde` as a standalone Docker Network Plugin, in order to create pure L2 networks.

To create a network, type the following command:
```bash
docker network create --driver=kathara/katharanp_vde:amd64 --ipam-driver=null l2net
# or
docker network create --driver=kathara/katharanp_vde:arm64 --ipam-driver=null l2net
```

To avoid assigning any IP subnet you **MUST** use `--ipam-driver=null` when creating networks with Docker plugin. Otherwise, the endpoint inside the container will always receive an IP address from the default pool.

### Attach Physical Interfaces and VLANs
**NOTE**: This feature is ONLY available for Linux-based operating systems.

</p>

It is possible to attach one or more host interfaces to a L2 LAN. Interfaces can either be physical interfaces or VLAN interfaces.
To do so, the interface should be attached to the corresponding VDE switch. The procedure is a bit more complex than the Linux bridge version, since it relies on a custom `vde_ext` util to perform the connection (installed inside the plugin container). In Kathar√°, this operation is automatically performed using the [`lab.ext`](https://www.kathara.org/man-pages/kathara-lab.ext.5.html) file, but it also possible to manually perform it.

First, search the name of the switch associated to the network (in this example `l2net`):
```bash
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER                    SCOPE
17366ac88720   bridge    bridge                    local
46e3206edb2a   host      host                      local
795c43f8b52d   l2net     kathara/katharanp:amd64   local
2cf01a87a072   none      null                      local
```

The name of the switch is `kt-<NETWORK ID>`, in the example `kt-795c43f8b52d`.

Search the ID of the Docker plugin:
```bash
$ docker plugin inspect kathara/katharanp_vde:amd64 | jq '.[0].Id'
# or
$ docker plugin inspect kathara/katharanp_vde:arm64 | jq '.[0].Id'

"08b6413ee58d9fce9e101dcd4fb6c5ba0643c5b40861d299b503d723413fa6fd"
```

Now, we can access the plugin container using `runc`:
```bash
sudo runc --root /run/docker/runtime-runc/plugins.moby exec -t 08b6413ee58d9fce9e101dcd4fb6c5ba0643c5b40861d299b503d723413fa6fd sh
```

Inside the container, we can use the `vde_ext` util to connect the physical/VLAN interface to the VDE switch. The `vde_ext` util requires the VDE socket path (`-s`), which is located in `/hosttmp/katharanp/<SWITCH NAME>/ctl`, a file path location where to store the PID of the process (`-p`), and the interface to connect. 

For example, if you want to attach the physical interface `enp0s3` to the `l2net`, type the following command:
```bash
vde_ext -s /hosttmp/katharanp/kt-795c43f8b52d/ctl -p /hosttmp/katharanp/kt-795c43f8b52d/pid_enp0s3 enp0s3 &
```

**NOTE**: The command should be detached from the current shell (using `&`).

Also, if you want to attach a VLAN interface with VLAN ID=10 (on top of the physical interface `enp0s3`) to the `l2net`, type the following commands (directly inside the plugin container):
```bash
# Create the VLAN interface
ip link add link enp0s3 name enp0s3.10 type vlan id 10
# Attach the interface to the switch
vde_ext -s /hosttmp/katharanp/kt-795c43f8b52d/ctl -p /hosttmp/katharanp/kt-795c43f8b52d/pid_enp0s3.10 enp0s3.10 &
```

To detach it, you have to kill the `vde_ext` process (using a `SIGINT` signal for proper handling):
```bash
kill -2 $(cat /hosttmp/katharanp/kt-795c43f8b52d/pid_enp0s3.10)
```
